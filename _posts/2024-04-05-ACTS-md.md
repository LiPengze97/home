ACTS: ACTS (AD Clinical Trial Simulation): Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation System


Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause (60%-80%) of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.1 It afflicts about 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for AD. The few drugs that have been approved for the treatment of AD are, at best, modestly effective. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) has become one of the most intractable problems in medicine.

Clinical trial simulation is an effective way to assess the feasibility, investigate assumptions, and optimize study design before conducting the actual trials.

In this study, we will create a framwork that clinical investigators can leverage for clinical trial simulation studies: (1) clinical trial eligibility criteria need to be represented in a formal and standard way that is compatible with EHR standards to retrieve the needed patient cohorts and associated patient phenotypes from EHR; and (2) a comprehensive pipeline and associated tools need to be implemented that could seamlessly align with large-scale EHR data.
