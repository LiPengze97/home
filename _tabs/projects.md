## Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation
ACTS (AD Clinical Trial Simulation): Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trial Simulation System

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause (60%-80%) of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.1 It afflicts about 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for AD. The few drugs that have been approved for the treatment of AD are, at best, modestly effective. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) has become one of the most intractable problems in medicine.

Clinical trial simulation is an effective way to assess the feasibility, investigate assumptions, and optimize study design before conducting the actual trials.

In this study, we will create a framwork that clinical investigators can leverage for clinical trial simulation studies: (1) clinical trial eligibility criteria need to be represented in a formal and standard way that is compatible with EHR standards to retrieve the needed patient cohorts and associated patient phenotypes from EHR; and (2) a comprehensive pipeline and associated tools need to be implemented that could seamlessly align with large-scale EHR data.

## Multiple Chronic Conditions's impact on Alzheimer's Disease

The “An end-to-end informatics framework to study Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)’s impact on Alzheimer’s Disease using harmonized electronic health records” project aims to revolutionize Alzheimer’s disease research. By enhancing the interoperability and utility of electronic health records (EHR), this collaborative effort led by UTHealth Houston, Mayo clinics, and University of Florida seeks to overcome the challenges posed by the lack of interoperability between different healthcare systems and the extensive manual annotation required for data extraction. This initiative promises to accelerate Alzheimer’s disease research, facilitating a deeper understanding of multi-chronic conditions associated with the disease, without compromising data integrity or patient privacy.

## Large Lanuage Model for Cardiovascular Diseses

Led by Dr. Jianfu Li, we are exploring algorithms and frameworks to aid risk predition, treatment recommendation, disease detection and other clinical needs using large language models and NLP.


## Deep Learning for Liver Transplant

Led by Dr. Ahmed Abdelhameed, we investigated the use of deep learning method in liver transplant using de-identified EHR data. In the near future, we are using multimodal data to strengthen our model and provide further clinical insight to help prediting risks in liver transplant patients.
