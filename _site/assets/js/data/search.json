    "content": "Social Determinant of Health Ontology (SDoH)An ontology formally representing Social Determinants of Health factors and the interrelationship among them.Social Determinants of Health Ontology (SDoHO)  has been developed to comprehensively represent the concepts, hierarchies, and relations pertinent to SDoH factors. The standardization characteristics of ontology with the comprehensive representation of SDoH are intended to address the current challenge of heterogeneity. By ensuring semantic interoperability and data FAIRness, which means data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, our proposed ontology can be applicable to downstream applications, such as natural language processing (NLP), and further help with the clinical decision.SDoHO is shaped for clinical medicine, public health, and biomedical informatics usages,     facilitating systematic SDoH knowledge representation, integration, and reasoning.    The creation and evaluation of the Social Determinants of Health Ontology (SDoHO)    The process was shown in Figure 1. The ontology was manually constructed in Protégé 5.5.0 and     represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL2), using data sources like official and institutional websites,     standardized medical vocabularies and ontologies, biomedical literature, and other resources like PhenX     toolkit (as listed in Table 1).        Table 1 : SDoHO data sources and examples              Source Type      Examples                  Official &amp; institutional websites      WHO,  CDC,  Healthy People 2020, Healthy People 2030,Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Rural Health information Hub,  Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS),  NEJM Catalyst,  National Academy of Medicine (NAM), Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,  and American Hospital Association (AHA)                    Standardized medical vocabularies &amp; ontologies      LOINC, SNOMED-CT, UMLS              Biomedical literature      [19,21–23]              Other resources      PhenX Toolkit      The construction of SDoHO followed a top-down (knowledge-driven) approach, initially defining classes based on   data sources, and then a bottom-up (data-driven) approach for evaluation/validation and refinement.   Definitions were primarily aligned with those available in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)   with the Concept Unique Identifier (CUI).For evaluation, we performed three rounds of semantic evaluation, where the organization of the ontology   was judged by three human experts. The interevaluator agreement score was calculated along with the   rational agreement score. Any disagreements were addressed iteratively until a consensus was reached.The coverage of the ontology was evaluated using real-world data from The Harris County   Psychiatric Center (HCPC) and the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center (OMC), and against the NIH   All of Us (AoU) Research Program’s SDoH survey.The future application of SDoHO includes leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and aiding in   clinical decision support. The design and evaluation process of SDoHO ensures its interoperability,   applicability, and scalability in various healthcare settings.ResultsWe constructed the SDoHO with 708 classes, 106 object properties, and 20 data properties,   with 1,561 logical axioms and 976 declaration axioms in the current version.   Three experts achieved 0.967 agreement in the semantic evaluation of the ontology.   A comparison between the coverage of the ontology and SDOH concepts   in 2 sets of clinical notes and a national survey instrument also showed satisfactory results.DiscussionSDoHO could potentially play an essential role in providing a foundation for a comprehensive   understanding of the associations between SDoH and health outcomes and paving the way for health   equity across populations.ConclusionSDoHO has well-designed hierarchies, practical objective properties, and versatile functionalities,   and the comprehensive semantic and coverage evaluation achieved promising performance compared to   the existing ontologies relevant to SDoH.To better understand the mechanism of our ontology, click on the following link to   the full paper at: https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocad096To download, click on Social Determinants of Health ontology (SDoHO).License: Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC 3.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"

    "content": "ACTS: ACTS (AD Clinical Trial Simulation): Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial Simulation SystemAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause (60%-80%) of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.1 It afflicts about 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for AD. The few drugs that have been approved for the treatment of AD are, at best, modestly effective. Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) has become one of the most intractable problems in medicine.Clinical trial simulation is an effective way to assess the feasibility, investigate assumptions, and optimize study design before conducting the actual trials.In this study, we will create a framwork that clinical investigators can leverage for clinical trial simulation studies: (1) clinical trial eligibility criteria need to be represented in a formal and standard way that is compatible with EHR standards to retrieve the needed patient cohorts and associated patient phenotypes from EHR; and (2) a comprehensive pipeline and associated tools need to be implemented that could seamlessly align with large-scale EHR data."

They are constructed from multiple     data sources through information extraction. Knowledge graphs play a growing important role in the field of     data science and artificial intelligence.The BDSI lab is interested in applying knowledge graphs in a variety of areas: ontology engineering for s    ocial determinants of health, drug repurposing through natural language processing, and disease prediction     with graph neural networks.APICNTRO TimeLine API: The CNTRO Timeline library is a Java library. This library is intended     to be used by developer and analysts who want to integrate this library in their workspace to compute      temporal information about clinical events.
