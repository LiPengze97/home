    "content": "ACTS: ACTS (AD Clinical Trial Simulation): Developing Advanced Informatics Approaches for an Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trial Simulation SystemAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause (60%-80%) of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.1 It afflicts about 44 million people worldwide, including 5.5 million in the United States. Currently, there is no cure for AD. The few drugs that have been approved for the treatment of AD are, at best, modestly effective. Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) has become one of the most intractable problems in medicine.Clinical trial simulation is an effective way to assess the feasibility, investigate assumptions, and optimize study design before conducting the actual trials.In this study, we will create a framwork that clinical investigators can leverage for clinical trial simulation studies: (1) clinical trial eligibility criteria need to be represented in a formal and standard way that is compatible with EHR standards to retrieve the needed patient cohorts and associated patient phenotypes from EHR; and (2) a comprehensive pipeline and associated tools need to be implemented that could seamlessly align with large-scale EHR data."

    "content": "We have created and implemented various ontology for health informatics usage.Alzheimer's Disease OntologyWe have built some AD/ADRD related ontologies and knowledge base including     Drug Repurposing-oriented Alzheimer's Disease Ontology (DROADO),     Dementia-Related Agitation Non-Pharmacological Treatment Ontology (DRANPTO),     and ADCareOnto - an ontology for personalized home care for persons with Alzheimer's disease.CNTRO (Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology) allows temporal information of clinical data     to be semantically annotated and queried, and use inference to expose new temporal features and relations based     on the semantic assertions and definitions of the temporal aspects in the ontology. Time Event Ontology (TEO)  has been developed in order to provide a formal conceptualization of temporal     structures in both structured data and textual narratives. To download, visit BioPortal at     TEO.Social Determinants of Health ontology (SDoHO) has been developed to comprehensively represent the concepts,     hierarchies, and relations pertinent to SDoH factors. The standardization characteristics of ontology with     the comprehensive representation of SDoH are intended to address the current challenge of heterogeneity.     By ensuring semantic interoperability and data FAIRness, which means data is Findable, Accessible,     Interoperable, and Reusable, our proposed ontology can be applicable to downstream applications,     such as natural language processing (NLP), and further help with the clinical decision.SDoHO is shaped for clinical medicine, public health, and biomedical informatics usages,     acilitating systematic SDoH knowledge representation, integration, and reasoning.To download, click on     Social Determinants of Health ontology (SDoHO).Knowledge GraphKnowledge graphs are used to organize structured knowledge in the world. They are constructed from multiple     data sources through information extraction. Knowledge graphs play a growing important role in the field of     data science and artificial intelligence.The BDSI lab is interested in applying knowledge graphs in a variety of areas: ontology engineering for s    ocial determinants of health, drug repurposing through natural language processing, and disease prediction     with graph neural networks.APICNTRO TimeLine API: The CNTRO Timeline library is a Java library. This library is intended     to be used by developer and analysts who want to integrate this library in their workspace to compute      temporal information about clinical events.
